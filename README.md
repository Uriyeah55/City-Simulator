## City Simulator, the most boring and generic name for a project

One day my friend and fellow coder [**Tom**](https://github.com/i-am-tom) told me about his idea to work on a project about citizens doing their own life. In my mind that would be a game like Cities Skyline but where you have absolutely zero control about what is going on so...
I decided to do the best approach a friend can do: <sub>steal his idea.</sub>

The project is still at an early stage, but citizens have:

* Health State
* Happiness Percentage
* Work Routine (--Happiness)
* Pay Mortdgage
* Have a really good day (++Happiness)

Future plans include:
- Having an associated house to pay
- Have random silly events, like being murdered to a raccoon
